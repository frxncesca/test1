          <h2>How can an app draw beauty industry professionals closer to each other and their clients?</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="case-study-prose-right">
          <p>The beauty industry today is saturated with many different artists of different skill level and qualification. There should be a better opportunity for finding and viewing portfolios of local beauty professionals. The beauty industry is not fully satisfied by existing social networking platforms. Social media sites like Facebook and Instagram are commonly used by beauty professionals and salons for posting informal photos but are not the best solution for browsing talent by location. Sites like LinkedIn and Behance are either not aimed towards trades jobs or are too industry specific. Salon finding apps mainly focus on in-app booking and promoting services under the name of a salon; excluding opportunity for employees and freelance beauty artists to promote themselves as an individual. The goal of Behind The Chair is to create a place that promotes beauty professionals to highlight their work, who they are and what they’ve accomplished in their career. The app must be useful to consumers as well as beauty professionals in order to modernize the beauty industry in today’s smartphone driven climate.</p>

              User: Tina is a photographer who works on lifestyle photography and editorial shoots in Toronto. She is always looking for new stylists to work with based on their creativity and is looking for an easy way to keep track of what is new in the local beauty scene. Since she is not offering beauty services and is just looking to browse she can make a basic user account to browse talent and trends locally or by search. <br><br>
              <b>Pro-user</b><br>
              A pro-user account can be used to host a profile with portfolio/credentials and browse talent and trends locally or by search.
              Pro-User: Elise is a freelance stylist with 2+ years experience at three different salons. She has enough experience to take on casual work but does not wish for full-time salon employment. She signs up with a pro-account to upload portfolio photos, her credentials and contact information so that she may become more visible to employers for possible contract work.<br><br>
              <b>Combination</b><br>
              Pro-User looking to hire: Dyane owns a small salon in Yorkville, Toronto. Her primary services are eyelash extensions and makeup for events and editorial. She is looking to have a freelance stylist come in on event-to-event basis in order to provide blowouts and styling to her clients for events, especially wedding parties (no cutting or colour service). Dyane searches for hair stylists in Toronto comes across Elise’s profile and views her portfolio and contact info. Dyane can see that Elise has good experience styling for weddings in her portfolio photos, has no formal beauty schooling but has worked in salons for 2+ years. Dyane can now contact Elise via the email on her profile for employment opportunities.</p>

          <h3>Screen Functions</h3>
        </div>

        <div class="case-study-prose-right">
          <p> <b>Discover Screen</b><br>
            This acts as a home feed and a way to find photos you've saved already. I wanted something similar to the 'discovery' section within the search tab of the instagram and tumblr apps, but I felt it could occupy the home page since my app has no 'following' feed. I wanted photos the user has 'liked' to be easily found after so that they can be revisited which is why they are at the top of the screen and can be expanded by clicking the 'more' photo. <br><br>
            <b>Search Screen</b><br>
            This uses a tab function similar to instagram in order to seach users, locations, hashtags and services all by one keyword. I might want to add a filter function for more specific searches. <br><br>
            <b>Notifications</b><br>
            This is how a user gets notified that someone has liked their photos or tagged them for work they have done on another person's photo. For example, if one user posts a photo of a model and did their makeup, they can tag another user who did the model's hair, etc. This photo would be shown in both of their profile portfolios so they have the option to accept or decline. <br><br>
            <b>Pro User Profile</b><br>
            This shows the user's information in categories and allows access to the portfolio by clicking on the '+50 more' image that could take to another page that would have a photo grid. <br><br>
            <b>Image Post</b><br>
            This is an enlarged image from a portfolio thumbnail. Similar to instagram but shows more detailed photo captions that include the photographer's credit if applicable and place to list what products were used in an organized way.

          View on <a href="https://invis.io/7M9KK1KAP">InVision</a>.<br>
          <p>After creating the first version of the primary function screens, InVision prototyping helped to put them to action and test on screen to see where improvements could be made in text hierarchy and basic screen flow. This version of the app was then tested in a 5 minute interaction by a participant at usertesting.com which can be viewed here.
          Insights gathered from the user test indicated that the user:
          <ul>
            <li>Could intuitively use the log in function</li>
            <li>Able to figure out interactions based on familiarity with instagram and pinterest</li>
            <li>Stated “User friendly and intuitive”</li>
            <li>Valued an abundance of information provided on pages</li>
            <li>Requested details on photo posts when selected</li>
            <li>Suggested to contact for a reference on how they performed</li>
            <li>Stated “Clean, colourful and user friendly”</li>

        </div>
        <div class="case-study-prose-right"> 
          <p> The first prototype is an example of a pro member logging in and checking their notifications. A key feature in the app is to allow pros to tag each other in photos which depict services they have provided. When accepted, a photo tag allows multiple members to take ownership of the photo. It will now show up in both of the owners' portfolio pages on their profiles.</p>
          <video controls="controls" name="Searching Profiles" src="../assets/casestudies/1/attempt3.mp4"></video> 
          <br><br>

          <p>The second prototype takes you through the motion of searching for user profiles on the app (starting from the discover page which is the main/home page of the app). Once a user is searched, you can click on their profile and view the different tabs within it.</p>
          <video controls="controls" name="Searching Profiles" src="../assets/casestudies/1/attempt1.mp4"></video> 
          <br><br>

          <p>The third prototype takes you through browsing trends to discover new photos. You can find the top trends by horizontally scrolling through the 'Trending Now' section. Once selecting a trend you can see the top 4 posts of that trend (photos with the most praises and saves by users) and scroll through the most recent as they are added. Selecting a photo brings you to its original post to see who owns it, the caption details and how many praises/saves it has. Praising the photo is equivalent to 'liking' or showing appreciation for a post while saving the photo would add it to 'My Favourites' on your account.</p>
