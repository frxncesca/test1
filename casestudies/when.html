        <div class="case-study-prose-right">
          <p><i>When</i> Is A Place is a book of experiences not based on lived experience. As a millennial, I chose to explore the concept of ‘austerity nostalgia’ for the war and post-war times of the 1930’s-1970’s as something that is romanticized and present in media and culture today. We are able to blend the past with the present by resurfacing aesthetics or ideals of the past. Thus, the novelty of nostalgia can invoke memories that are not based on real, lived experience, including in audiences too young to have experienced these times first-hand. By combining memories shared by older generations, nostalgic pop-culture and drawing from lived experience, anyone can create their own sense of the past. These vast varieties of nostalgic influences make it hard for one not to relate fictional experience to ‘real’ experience; the two may become indistinguishable at times, leaving it to imagination to fill-in the blanks.<br> <br>

          This book is meant to create an experience through a combination of writings, collage and physical artifacts. The prologue presents a brief overview of the concept of austerity nostalgia and its contemporary appeal as well as a personal reflection on nostalgia. Following the prologue is Joan Didion’s 1968 essay titled “On Keeping A Notebook”, from her book <i>Slouching Towards Bethlehem</i>, interlaced with collage and ephemera to touch and analyze.

          <p>“On Keeping A Notebook” is an inquisitive exploration of both real and fabricated memories recorded in the author’s notebook. Brief notes which recount scenes or characters allow her to look back and create her own meaning. The idea of collecting fragmented pieces, like Didion does, struck a chord with my perception of memory and nostalgia. The author accepts and embraces her self-deception and finds comfort in it solely for the fact that reality seems to bore her. By inserting herself into a past life she reconnects with past iterations of herself. Ultimately, Didion’s fascination with the idealized imagery that comes with her fabricated memories is an example of using nostalgia as escapism.<br><br>

        Collage is the most direct result of critique and nostalgia, which made it the most appropriate method for my visual research. Sourcing imagery from 1930’s-1970’s magazines connects the past to the present by repurposing the familiar. The images are representative of the sensationalized banality of the past and flirt with the idea that utopia is, or once was, attainable.

          <p>Old and obsolete ephemera from my father’s antique collection are dispersed throughout the book, without any description or history, leaving it to the reader to create meaning from old artifacts which they have no personal connection to. An old letter from a soldier addressed to his mother in 1942 connotes sentimental value, but without real context of who the sender or receiver is, one’s own account of it when viewing it for the first time today would be essentially invalid. Delving past the surface-level charm of nostalgia can lead one to consider that memories can be borrowed and are not fact; they are simply an account which can change or distort over time.<br><br>
          In a way, the book started to become a collection of collections: my own paper materials, my father’s antiques and Joan’s hazy memories. Things fell into place as I researched, visualized and reflected on the experience of nostalgia and eventually led me to designing a process that designed itself.

          My first attempt at narrowing down a topic was to research the sublime. I was interested in the characterization of the sublime as “experiences which provoke a perverse pleasure that mixes fear and delight.” I focused on collage, distortion and juxtaposition of images through a combination of research and visual exploration over the course of a semester. Through a series of exercises I created my own imagery using photography, typography and collage. Collage became one of my primary mediums due to its ability to repurpose the familiar. Ideas of kitsch and the collective consciousness dictated by popular culture interested me and eventually led me to explore memory and nostalgia.

          My focus on nostalgia stemmed from an exercise in which I used found-images to create a small flip-book titled <i>Cut Copy</i> that focused on distortion, substitution and transition of images. I sourced the images from 1940’s-50’s Life magazines and were drawn to these particular images for their ability to create stimulation and curiosity when taken out of context (without text description).

          <h3>Austerity Nostalgia</h3>
        </div>

        <div class="case-study-prose-right">
          <h5>“The experience of nostalgia may facilitate the kind of coherence, consistency, and sense of identity that each of us so desperately needs.”</h5> <h3>—<i>Sanctuary of Meaning</i> by Janelle L. Wilson</h3>
          <p> <br>
          Nostalgia for the 20th century is romanticized, mythologized and recycled in pop-culture. The novelty of nostalgia can be experienced by anyone, including audiences that are too young to have experienced it first-hand. Whether nostalgic claims of the past are objectively true or not, it is important to understand why they emerge and what effect they have on individual or collective experience. How much of what we remember is accurate? Were the “good old days” really that good? <br><br>
          I became fascinated with the picture-perfect snapshot old magazines from the 40’s-50’s provided. The nature of my source materials led me to focus more specifically on the concept of austerity nostalgia which characterizes the public modernism of the 1930’s to early 1970’s. A rose-tinted recollection of this period depicts simpler times with family and safety at the core of daily life; a longing for ‘the good ol’ days’. Austerity nostalgia has been lingering in the present presumably due to a lost sense of community and security in the Western world. The current political climate of the United States is indication of how austerity nostalgia is often used as a conservative tactic for restoring some idea of civic order. Author Owen Hatherley explains this need for reverting to the past in his book called The Ministry of Nostalgia. Hatherley explains it as, “the need to get back to the place or moment before the country lost its moral and cultural bearings”, which fits in nicely with the Republican campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again.” It is almost as if sensationalism is a way for society to avoid total boredom. <br><br><br>

          <h2>Drawing Personal Conclusions</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="case-study-prose-right">
          <p>
            Exploring the concept of nostalgia led me to personal discoveries I never originally intended to come about. The process allowed me to explore nostalgia present in my own life, from my own experience and exploration of old artifacts. Every step of the way, my research and visual experiments led me back to my father’s resources. He has a vast collection of anything old sitting in my basement; stamps, letters, knick-knacks, war memorabilia, not in any order and some not even on display (and that’s just the small things). It was the first time I have actually looked into his collection and attempt to learn about it.  I lucky to have access to his variety of magazines ranging from the 1930’s-1960’s as well as a mostly-functional typewriter—the I and the J do keys not work. <br><br>
            My parent’s house is absolutely packed with antiques and memorabilia pieces on display. From milk bottles to clocks, paintings, toys, and oil lamps all collected by my father. It is important to note that as being a millennial, my experiences of the past shared by my father are purely secondary, and much of the knowledge my father has of the past is gathered second-hand. Since he was born in Italy in 1952, he would have been too young to fully understand and experience a lot of the complexities and pop-culture of the Western World before he immigrated to Canada. He also would have been too poor as a child to own any of the vintage toys he now collects.<br><br>
            The idea of collecting fragmented pieces like Joan Didion does in her 1968 essay On Keeping a Notebook struck a chord with my perception of memory and nostalgia. Joan has an inquisitive exploration of her own fabricated memories to which she creates her own meaning. Joan accepts and embraces her self-deception and finds comfort in it solely for the fact that reality seems to bore her. By inserting herself into a past life she reconnects with past iterations of herself, alluding to the fact that she does so quite often—every time she looks in her notebook. She is more fascinated by the idealized imagery that comes with her fabricated memories and uses nostalgia as escapism.<br><br>
            Maybe the brief sense of pleasure nostalgia triggers is worth the sense of loss that follows. <br> Perhaps she and my father have something in common.
