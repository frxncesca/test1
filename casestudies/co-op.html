          <h2>How can a traditional taxi company reposition itself in today’s disrupted ride service industry?<h2/>
        </div>
        <div class="case-study-prose-right">
          <p>Rebranding Co-op Cabs and Crown Taxi is necessary for repositioning them in the industry as one cohesive, recognizable brand. This new brand will give Co-op Cabs the edge they need to compete with highly successful and technologically advanced companies that have disrupted the industry. Co-operative values and the belief that private gain should never outweigh public safety is what makes them different. Co-op Cabs have been serving Toronto since 1956 and recently merged with Crown Taxi, keeping their fleets separate in name. As a co-operative business, the drivers own their vehicles and are shareholders in the business, unlike most ride service companies.

          <h2>Research</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="case-study-prose-right">
          <p>The process began with extensive research on the current state of the cab industry and taxi regulations for the city of Toronto. I compiled and designed a thorough business analysis report to understand the organization, their history, mission, culture, audience, market and their competition. By doing this, I was able to better assess the current identity and the weaknesses that needed to be addressed. The major weakness faced by most cab companies is not being able to keep up with tech ride-service companies like Uber who have been a major disruption in the industry. A main focus in the design strategy was to try and find an opportunity to mitigate this weakness and reposition them as unique and current.

        </div>
        <div class="case-study-prose-right">
          <p>One thing that became clear right away was the need for reframing Co-op Cabs in order to stand out amongst their vast competition. They have the opportunity to build upon the public’s fascination with collaborative business models of their tech-savvy competition. Their co-operative values and dedication to safety and accessibility are an asset to the brand I wanted to develop. Most importantly, I knew the brand should emphasize that they are Torontonians driving for Toronto by embodying these keywords: experience, knowledge, community, and safety. Promoting the drivers as such can gives them something in common with their customers as they are both living, working in or exploring the city.

          <p> All features of the identity were outlined by creating a brand guideline book. These guidelines serve the needs of the identity system, client and any third parties who may need
to create extensions of the brand materials. They also provide direction and rules that best project and maintain the identification platform in a clear and friendly manner. The success of this identity relies on consistent application across all communication tools and assets in order for Co-op Cabs to become a well-recognized player in today’s ride service industry.

As part of developing the brand, I shaped it to the necessary digital and physical applications. All of these applications were kept in mind from the beginning stages of developing the brand mark and logotype. Overall, the new identity has a clean and flat look that compliments the new tech side of the industry.

          <p>After weeks of sketching and refining, the final symbol is a linked shape with round features and multiple colours. The symbol is inspired by linkage, community and wayfinding. The vibrant colours coming together represent the diversity of Toronto and the company’s unique co-operative values. The black background gives the colours an extra pop of vibrancy that is integral to the identity. It can also be displayed on a white background for more practical applications such as stationary—to preserve printing costs. The negative space that serves as a hyphen is made to resemble the rounded links that make up the symbol. The logotype shares the round features of the symbol while still looking professional and legible.

        </div>
       
        <div class="case-study-prose-right">
          <p>The recent technology innovations within the ride-sharing industry have created an expanded pool of customers that have taken advantage of an easier way to order and pay for car services with their smartphones. These innovations facilitate connectivity between customers and drivers which eliminates the guesswork for fares and arrival times. Mobile ordering apps for cabs should learn from the user-intuitive features coined by their competitors.
            <br>
            I created a mock-up of what the ordering platform would look like for the company’s new brand. Their existing app is cluttered and not very user-intuitive, which can deter people from ordering. I wanted to minimize the steps it would take to order a car. The phone screens below show the ordering process after a user account is made.
