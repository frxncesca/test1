          <h2>How can we redesign the traditional graduate showcase to address its weaknesses and satisfy all stakeholders?</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="case-study-prose-right">
          <div><p>The York University and Sheridan College joint program in design (YSDN) is a prestigious graphic design school that produces a wide range of graduates with various specializations. The program offers everything from package design to motion design, which gives students many different deliverables to present in their portfolio of work. Figuring out how to display physical, print, digital and interactive work equally for over 80 students has always been a challenge for shows in the past, as some groups are left feeling underrepresented due to lack of space or being limited to showing their work only in photographs or stills. We wanted to scrap the old format and rethink the show entirely, to make sure we were making the most of our culmination (and tuition) at YSDN.<br> <br>

          Typically, YSDN graduation shows were 1-3 day events held at the Liberty Grand in downtown Toronto for one to three days, and students had individual presentation boards to set up their work and stand beside for the duration of the show. Usually the viewing times for industry members and students’ family and friends were assigned one day each. Many weaknesses were apparent—limited access and viewing time, the shows’ ephemeral nature, and low engagement with our respective school communities as well as with the public. Most importantly, the show was an overwhelming undertaking for the students who not only had to setup and teardown, but be stuck at their boards for the duration of the show. With these weaknesses in mind, we created our strategy and scope for a brand new show.

          We outlined the stakeholders and listed their <b>goals</b>. This became the information we would constantly refer back to when making decisions:<br><br>

          <b>Graduates</b> <br>
          Showcase their work, network with industry, and celebrate.
          <br><br>
          <b>Family & Friends</b> <br>

          View student work, network and recruit, and learn about YSDN and current design education.

          <h2>The Brand Identity</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="case-study-prose-right">
          <p> Unifying the diversity of voices within our program was a lengthy process taken on by the Branding Team, lead by executive team members Camilla Dinardo and Simone Robert. Rather than focusing on the temporal quality of graduation, the team focused on the experience that we could all undoubtedly identify with in some form: our education. This led them to realize that the diversity of experience in YSDN could not be accurately captured by a static brand. Instead, the approach to the identity system had a fluid and dynamic framework, which served to accommodate the voices of our class. <br><br>

          The central element of the brand identity is eight lines, referencing the number of semesters in our degree. Together they create four arrows that represent our forward-thinking nature and the next step in our journey after graduation. Variations of the eight lines signify the different solutions we explore in a design challenge. The backgrounds of the visual framework are extrusions of student work, which is both a literal and abstract representation of the design progression to a completed piece. The process of creating these abstractions guaranteed cohesiveness, but no two could be exactly the same.

        <div class="case-study-prose-right">
          <p> The showcase visited locations across the GTA with exhibitions at Sheridan College (Trafalgar Campus), York University (Keele Campus), The Gladstone Hotel and Konrad Group. The various locations allowed us to interact with both school communities, family, friends and the public. The exhibition was comprised of these main components:<br><br>

          <b>Panels</b> <br>
          Each student was given a 36x24in panel to display photos of the works of their choosing, accompanied by short image captions.
          <br><br>
          <b>Kiosk Touch Screens</b> <br>
          The first allowed students to display up to three motion or web design projects, the second premiered the YSDN2017 official website and the third an interactive piece which allowed users t
          <br><br>
          <b>Bookshelves</b> <br>
          students could choose 1 book or magazine to display on our custom built bookshelf displays.
          <br><br>
          <b>Packaging Table</b> <br>
          Students could choose 1 package design or physical object to display on a table.

          <h2>The Publication</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="case-study-prose-right">
          <p> Unlike domains that expire, or exhibitions that only last a few days, creating a publication of student work could let the accomplishments and hard work put into the showcase last forever. It was important for us to create a piece which fully encapsulated our graduating class and will continue to do so for years in the future. It also allowed for a more digestible way to present work from over 80 students so the reader can look through at their own leisure. With the money we raised, and with the help of our sponsors—especially Veritiv for donating the paper—we were able to produce 1000 di-cut, soft cover copies of our 213 page publication.
